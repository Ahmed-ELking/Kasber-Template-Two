# Kasber-Template-Two

Sample responsive app for all devices **_without any framework_**

## Overview

1. Building something dynamic is definitely a skill you will find useful throughout your Frontend development journey. Using Javascript in just skeleton code is like giving life to Pinocchio.

2. Using Intersection Observer JavaScript API is some of advanced programming.

3. The implementation of responsiveness of the website is aptly implemented:
   - No matter what size, I make the browser screen, the features click, scroll, highlighting of sections  etc.. are working in all the sizes.
   - This is especially important to increase reachability of your application. There are many different types of screen sizes and resolutions, if our app doesn't render on someone's device, they won't be interested in using our product.
4. Styling has been added for the active states:
   - This is a good thing, as stateful design is a part of good UX. It makes the life of user easier. And helps them navigate my website much faster.
